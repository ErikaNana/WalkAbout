General Notes
-------------
need to extend SherlockFragmentActivity so can use Fragments

Using Google Maps Android API
-----------------------------
-need to obtain API key
	-retrieve info about app's certificate
	-register a project in the Google APIs Console and add the Maps API as a service for the project
	-request one or more keys
	-add key to application and begin development
-specify settings in the Application Manifest
-Add map to new/existing Android project

Using Google Maps for this Application
--------------------------------------
-incorporate a Google Maps map in the application
-provide basic map utilities such as My Location button and Zoom controls
-we will not be calling Google Maps app directly
	-rather, implement own MapFragment in application and use Google's services to maintain it
	
Difference between Google Maps API and Google Maps Android API
---------------------------------------------------------------
Google Maps Android API is a child of Google Maps API
	-maintained specifically for using Google Maps services in Android devices
Google Maps API
	-represents collection of APIs related to using GoogleMaps services
	-the primary Google Maps API is the Javascript web-based version that allows for
	embedding and manipulating Google Maps in web pages
		-that is the version that many websites use to display Google Maps in a web browser
		
API Key
-------
In the Google Console site
	-contains info about who owns the key, when it was activated and which Android
	applications it may be used for, as well as the key itself
	
Using SupportMapFragment
-----------------------
Google Maps Android API v2 are contained inside MapFragments
-MapFragment only works for API 12 or higher
	-using Android Support library, can utilize the MapFragment
	functionality through a class called SupportMapFragment that works
	for API versions below 12
	
Error: Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfo
----------------------------------------------------
To fix:
	-since extending FragmentActivity
		-Right click project
		-Properties
		-Java Build Path
		-Order and Export tab
		-check Android Private Libraries
